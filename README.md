Angular 1.x Demo Application - Find Server
====================================================

This module checks income urls on availability and returns one with higher priority.
Please user array of objects as a test data, like:
[
    {
      "url": "http://doesNotExist.boldtech.co",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "url": "https://nixsolutions.github.io/demo-ng1-http-checker/",
      "priority": 2
    }
]

The app demonstrates work of servers searching algorithm. The demo receives a list of servers with different priority.  It sends requests to all  servers (in the sequence priority ) in order to check their availability(200-th status) and returns one server with the highest priority. This algorithm can be used in tasks like finding the nearest server based on the userâ€™s location.
